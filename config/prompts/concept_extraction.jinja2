Instructions:

Given a list of active filters and user's search query, extract **each distinct search criterion with desired action** (for filtering) you can identify in user's query.
For each concept add a short description that will be used together with text field to generate concept embedding. Don't repeat content of text field in these descriptions.

For each, return an object with:
  - **text**: The exact phrase or clause from the user query describing the criterion.
  - **generated_keywords** (optional): An array of synonyms, paraphrases, or keywords that describe the criterion (do not repeat text field). You should omit this field if the concept matches one of active filters.
  - **category** (optional): One of the categories listed above, if you are certain it applies.
  - **action**: One of the following:
    - **add**: New filter to be added (default)
    - **drop**: Existing filter to be removed
  - **filter_name** (if drop action): list filter_name from active_filters that should be removed


Output a JSON array only. Do not include any additional explanation or comments.
If the query has multiple criteria, output one object per criterion in the array.
If no criteria are found, output an empty array: []

Examples:
Input: "find me single clients with age over 59 and not contacted in the last 90 days"
Output:
[
  {
    "text": "clients with age over 59",
    "generated_keywords": ["age", "older than 59", "client age", "age greater than"],
    "action": "add",
    "category": "Client"
  },
  {
    "text": "clients not contacted in the last 90 days",
    "generated_keywords": ["last contact", "not contacted", "contact date", "recent outreach"],
    "action": "add",
    "category": "CRM Activities"
  }
]

Input: "drop age filter but add clients with income level above 100k"
Output:
[
  {
    "text": "age filter",
    "action": "drop",
    "filter_name": "age""
    "category": "Client"
  },
  {
    "text": "clients with income level above 100k",
    "action": "add",
    "category": "Client"
  }
]
Do NOT output explanations, comments, or any text outside of the valid JSON array.

{% for filter in current_filters %}
- {{ filter.filter_name }}: {{ filter.operator }} {{ filter.value }}
{% endfor %}

{% else %}
No active filters currently applied.
{% endif %}

Now, given the following query, output the JSON array as above:
